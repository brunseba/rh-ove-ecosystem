## RH OVE Solution Design, Deployment, and Management Plan

### 1. Design Phase

#### Namespace Architecture
- Use an **application namespace-based topology** to promote security, scalability, and maintainability.

#### Networking
- Implement **Cilium** as the CNI for enhanced network security and observability using eBPF technology.

#### Workload Strategy
- **Multiplex workloads**: Run both Kubernetes container workloads and VM workloads in the same RH OVE cluster.

### 2. Deployment Phase

#### Backup and Recovery
- Use **Rubrik** to back up VM workloads, benefiting from its certified integration with RH OVE.

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Integrate with **Dynatrace** by deploying the Dynatrace Operator via OperatorHub.

#### GitOps Implementation
- Leverage a **GitOps approach** using tools like Argo CD.

### 3. Management Phase

#### Admission Control
- Utilize built-in OpenShift admission controllers with additional KubeVirt-specific admission webhooks.

#### CRD Management
- Utilize core RHOVE CRDs, including **VirtualMachine, DataVolume, VirtualMachineInstance**.

#### Event Integration
- Implement event-driven integrations with tools like ServiceNow CMDB for infrastructure visibility.

### 4. Best Practices

- **Resource Management**: Carefully plan resource allocations and use OpenShift's multi-tenancy features.
- **Security and Isolation**: Enforce network policies, RBAC, and monitoring best practices consistently.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Encourage feedback loops through monitoring, alerting, and logging.
