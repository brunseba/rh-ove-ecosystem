# RH OVE Infrastructure Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This sub-project focuses on the comprehensive setup and operation of the RH OVE infrastructure, targeting the study, design, implementation, testing, and Day-2 operations of the multi-cluster environment.

## Scope

Ensure the complete lifecycle of infrastructure operation, from study to implementation and ongoing support. This includes designing and deploying core components, establishing monitoring and security protocols, and documenting operational procedures.

## Documentation Areas
- **Architecture**: Review and define the network, storage, and IAM strategies.
- **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**: Finalize key decisions including multi-cluster patterns and GitOps.
- **Deployment**: Identify prerequisites, and cover installation and configuration tasks.
- **Management**: Focus on admission control, GitOps, monitoring, and backup strategies.
- **Operations**: Develop detailed guidance for day-to-day operations, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.

## Work Phases
1. **Study Phase**
   - Gather comprehensive understanding of current and future needs.
   - Perform gap analysis on existing infrastructure.

2. **Design Phase**
   - Create High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) documents.
   - Validate designs against organizational goals.

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Deploy infrastructure components utilizing best practices.
   - Integrate security, monitoring, and backup systems.

4. **Testing Phase**
   - Conduct thorough infrastructure robustness, security, and performance tests.
   - Validate alignment with ADRs.

5. **Day-2 Operations Phase**
   - Establish ongoing monitoring.
   - Document troubleshooting and tuning procedures.

## Required Personas
- **Infrastructure Architect**: Define overarching infrastructure architecture.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Implement and automate delivery using CI/CD and GitOps.
- **System Administrator**: Oversee operations, ensuring stability and performance.
- **Security Engineer**: Ensure alignment with security protocols and compliance.
- **Network Engineer**: Design and implement network components and policies.

## Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure that supports RH OVE multi-cluster functionality.
- Full documentation of operational guidelines and procedures.
- Stakeholder satisfaction with alignment to strategic goals.
