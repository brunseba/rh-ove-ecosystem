# Migration Workload from VMware Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This sub-project focuses on the migration of existing workloads from VMware environments to the RH OVE platform. The migration will ensure minimal downtime and optimal performance while maintaining functionality and business continuity.

## Scope

Plan and execute the migration of workloads from VMware environments to RH OVE, including assessment of current workloads, migration strategy development, testing, and operation of migrated components.

## Documentation Areas
- **VM Lifecycle**: VM importation, template management, scaling performance, and backup recovery strategies.
- **Migration-Specific ADRs**: Strategy decisions, compatibility considerations, and performance optimization.
- **Migration Planning**: Assessment procedures, migration waves, risk mitigation, and rollback procedures.

## Work Phases
1. **Study Phase**
   - Inventory and analyze existing VMware workloads and their requirements.
   - Identify dependencies and performance baselines.

2. **Design Phase**
   - Create migration strategies with comprehensive HLD and LLD documentation.
   - Define migration waves and prioritization.

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Execute migration workflows.
   - Import VMs and configure templates in the new environment.

4. **Testing Phase**
   - Validate workload functionality and performance post-migration.
   - Ensure compliance with business requirements.

5. **Day-2 Operations Phase**
   - Develop monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery procedures for migrated workloads.
   - Document lessons learned and operational guidelines.

## Required Personas
- **Migration Specialist**: Lead migration strategy and execution.
- **VMware Administrator**: Provide expertise on source environment and legacy systems.
- **RH OVE Engineer**: Implement target environment configurations and optimization.
- **Application Owner**: Validate business functionality post-migration.
- **Performance Engineer**: Ensure performance requirements are met in the new environment.
- **Backup Administrator**: Implement backup and recovery procedures for migrated workloads.

## Success Criteria
- Successful migration of all critical workloads with minimal disruption to business operations.
- Achievement of performance parity or improvement post-migration.
- Complete decommissioning of legacy VMware infrastructure where applicable.
- Comprehensive documentation of migration procedures and operational guidelines.
