3. **Use-Cases ↔ Migration**: Some use-cases may serve as migration validation scenarios

### Shared Resources
- **Documentation Standards**: Common templates and style guides
- **Testing Framework**: Shared testing methodologies and tools
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Common monitoring stack across all projects
