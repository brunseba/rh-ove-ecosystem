## Risk Assessment Scale

### Probability Scale
- **1 - Very Low** (0-10%): Risk unlikely to occur
- **2 - Low** (11-30%): Risk may occur in exceptional circumstances
- **3 - Medium** (31-50%): Risk may occur under certain conditions
- **4 - High** (51-80%): Risk likely to occur in most circumstances
- **5 - Very High** (81-100%): Risk almost certain to occur

### Impact Scale
- **1 - Very Low**: Minimal impact on project objectives
