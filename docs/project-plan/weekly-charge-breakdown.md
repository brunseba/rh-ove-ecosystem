## Notes

1. **Part-time allocation**: Infrastructure Architect works part-time (2.5 days/week) during Implementation phase
2. **Resource multiplication**: Numbers in parentheses (e.g., 2x, 3x) indicate multiple resources of the same type
3. **Phase overlap**: Some personas work across multiple phases with varying intensity
4. **Workload estimates**: Based on standard 5-day work weeks for full-time resources
5. **Flexibility**: Resource allocation can be adjusted based on project needs and availability

---

## Risk Factors Affecting Workload

1. **Skill scarcity**: Specialized RH OVE and migration expertise may require extended timelines
2. **Timeline compression**: Accelerated delivery may require additional parallel resources
3. **Scope changes**: Additional use-cases or migration complexity could increase workload
4. **Resource availability**: Team member availability and scheduling conflicts may impact timelines
5. **Learning curve**: New team members may require additional time for technology familiarization
