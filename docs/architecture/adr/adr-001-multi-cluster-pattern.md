# ADR-001: Multi-Cluster Architecture Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-12-01

## Context
The RH OVE ecosystem needs to support multiple environments (production, staging, development) while maintaining centralized governance, security, and operational oversight. The organization requires scalable infrastructure that can grow horizontally and support geographic distribution.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-cluster architecture pattern with:
- **One Management Cluster**: Centralized control plane for governance, GitOps, security, and monitoring
- **Multiple Application Clusters**: Dedicated workload execution environments per environment type

## Rationale

### Advantages
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between management and workload execution
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling by adding application clusters as needed
3. **Security**: Network-level isolation between environments
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Centralized management reduces operational overhead
5. **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one cluster don't affect others
6. **Resource Optimization**: Right-size clusters based on workload requirements

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Single Large Cluster**: Rejected due to blast radius and resource contention
2. **Completely Separate Clusters**: Rejected due to operational complexity and lack of centralized governance
3. **Namespace-based Multi-tenancy**: Rejected due to insufficient isolation for production workloads

## Implementation Details

### Management Cluster Components
- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)
- ArgoCD Hub for GitOps
- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)
- Federated Prometheus for monitoring
- Centralized logging aggregation
- Rubrik backup management

### Application Cluster Types
- **Production**: High-availability, performance-optimized
- **Staging**: Production-like for testing
- **Development**: Resource-optimized for development workflows

### Network Architecture
- Dedicated network segments per cluster type
- VPN/Private connectivity between management and application clusters
- Zero-trust network principles

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved security posture through cluster-level isolation
- Simplified compliance and audit processes
- Better resource utilization and cost optimization
- Enhanced disaster recovery capabilities
- Reduced blast radius for security incidents

### Negative
- Increased network complexity
- Additional operational overhead for cluster lifecycle management
- Potential data synchronization challenges
- Learning curve for multi-cluster operations

## Compliance Considerations
- Meets enterprise security requirements for environment isolation
- Supports regulatory compliance through audit trail separation
- Enables data residency requirements through geographic cluster placement

## Monitoring and Observability
- Centralized metrics collection via Prometheus federation
- Unified logging through log forwarding to management cluster
- Cross-cluster distributed tracing capabilities
- Centralized alerting and incident management
