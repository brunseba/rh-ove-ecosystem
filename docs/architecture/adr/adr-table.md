### Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Dependencies:**
- **ADR-008 (IAM)** must be completed before GitOps and Admission Control implementation
- **ADR-003 (Namespace Topology)** enables proper RBAC integration with IAM
- **ADR-007 (Monitoring)** requires IAM integration for authentication and authorization
- **ADR-002 (GitOps)** requires IAM for secure access control and audit trails

**Parallel Implementation Opportunities:**
- ADR-005 (Network CNI) can be implemented in parallel with IAM setup
- ADR-006 (Backup) and ADR-007 (Monitoring) can be implemented concurrently in final phase
