# ADR-006: Backup Strategy for RH OVE Ecosystem

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-12-01

## Context
Ensuring data protection and recovery is crucial for the RH OVE multi-cluster environment. The solution must support frequent, secure, and efficient backups across clusters, aligning with business continuity and compliance requirements.

## Decision
Adopt a centralized backup strategy using **Rubrik** for VM and containerized workloads, providing consistency, compliance, and ease of management.

## Rationale

### Advantages
1. **Unified Management**: Single pane of glass for managing backups across clusters
2. **Policy-Driven**: Flexibility in configuring backup policies per application/business need
3. **Deduplication and Compression**: Reduce storage costs by minimizing redundant data
4. **Cloud Integration**: Support for hybrid cloud scenarios and long-term data retention
5. **Application Consistency**: Automated application-aware snapshot management

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Velero**: Open-source alternative
   - **Pros**: Strong integration with Kubernetes ecosystems
   - **Cons**: Complexity in VM integration and limited cloud support
   - **Rejected**: Difficulties in ensuring VM workload consistency and enterprise support

2. **DIY Scripting Solutions**: Custom in-house scripts
   - **Pros**: Potentially customizable
   - **Cons**: Highly error-prone, difficult to manage at scale
   - **Rejected**: Lack of enterprise features, consistency guarantees, and support

## Implementation Details

### Backup Policy Design
- **Daily Backups**: RPO of 24 hours for critical workloads
- **Weekly Full Backup with Daily Incrementals**: Optimizes storage usage
- **Data Encryption**: Both in transit and at rest using AES-256

### Backup Architecture
```
Backup Architecture
├── Management Cluster
│   ├── Rubrik Management Node
│   └── Centralized Backup Policy Management
├── Application Clusters
│   ├── Rubrik Edge Devices
│   ├── Local Snapshot Agents
│   └── Data Replica Agents
└── Cloud Archive
    ├── Long Term Retention Storage
    └── Cross-Region DR Copies
```

### Configuration Example
```yaml
apiVersion: backup.rubrik.com/v1alpha1
kind: BackupPolicy
metadata:
  name: application-backup-policy
  namespace: backup
spec:
  frequency: "24h"
  retention:
    local: "30d"
    cloud: "365d"
  snapshotConsistency: "crash-consistent"
  includeVolumes: "all"
  excludeVolumes:
  - "scratch"
  encryption: enabled
  replication:
    target: cloud-archive
    frequency: "12h"
```

## Security and Compliance Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: All backup data encrypted with AES-256
- **Access Control**: Role-based access for backup management and retrieval
- **Audit Trails**: Detailed logging of backup and restore operations
- **Compliance Alignment**: Meets GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 requirements

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Reduced Risk**: Comprehensive DR strategy minimizes impact of data loss events
- **Operational Visibility**: Centralized monitoring and alerting of backup status
- **Strategic Flexibility**: Support for hybrid cloud and multi-region deployments

### Negative
- **Cost Considerations**: Could incur higher upfront Costa than open-source alternatives
- **Training Requirement**: Backup administrators require training in Rubrik solutions

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Planning
1. Define business-critical systems and RPO/RTO requirements
2. Design initial backup policy and architecture
3. Identify data sovereignty and compliance requirements

### Phase 2: Non-Production Deployment
1. Pilot Rubrik deployment in development environment
2. Test backup and restore operations thoroughly
3. Validate compliance alignment with internal and external audits

### Phase 3: Production Rollout
1. Deploy Rubrik management in the production environment
2. Migrate to production backup policies with minimal downtime
3. Enable monitoring and alerting on backup status

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement
1. Regular policy reviews to adapt to changing business needs
2. Leverage Rubrik analytics for optimizations and reporting
3. Update DR plans based on lessons learned and testing

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Monitoring Metrics
- Backup success/failure rates
- Storage consumption over time
- Deduplication and compression efficiency
- RPO and RTO performance

### Alerting Setup
```yaml
groups:
- name: backup-alerts
  rules:
  - alert: BackupFailure
    expr: rubrik_backup_failed{job="rubrik-agent"}  0
    for: 10m
    labels:
      severity: critical
  - alert: RPOViolation
    expr: rubrik_backup_rpo{target="24h"} =r 24 * 60 * 60
    labels:
      severity: warning
```

This comprehensive backup strategy ensures that RH OVE can achieve high data availability, integrity, and compliance, aligning with enterprise best practices for data protection and disaster recovery.
