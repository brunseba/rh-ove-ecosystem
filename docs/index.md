# RH OVE Ecosystem Design and Management

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for designing, deploying, and managing Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine (RH OVE) solutions.

## Solution Overview

This documentation covers a complete RH OVE ecosystem implementation with the following key components:

    subgraph "RH OVE Ecosystem"
        A[Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine] --> B[Cilium CNI]
        A --> C[Kyverno Admission Control]
        A --> D[GitOps with Argo CD]
        A --> E[Dynatrace Monitoring]
        A --> F[Rubrik Backup]
        A --> G[ServiceNow CMDB Integration]
    end

        H[VM Workloads]
        I[Container Workloads]
    end

    A --> I
```

## Key Features

### 1. Design Phase
- **Application namespace-based topology** for security and scalability
- **Cilium CNI** for enhanced network security with eBPF
- **Mixed workload strategy** supporting both VMs and containers

### 2. Deployment Phase
- **Rubrik integration** for enterprise backup and recovery
- **Dynatrace monitoring** for comprehensive observability
- **GitOps methodology** using Argo CD for declarative management

### 3. Management Phase
- **Enhanced admission control** with OpenShift defaults plus Kyverno policies
- **CRD-based management** leveraging KubeVirt resources
- **Event-driven integrations** with CMDB systems

### 4. Best Practices
- Resource management and multi-tenancy
- Security and isolation enforcement
- Continuous improvement through monitoring

### 5. References
Comprehensive product documentation and URIs for all integrated components.

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md)
2. Follow the [Installation Guide](deployment/installation.md)
3. Configure [Admission Control](management/admission-control.md)
4. Set up [Monitoring](management/monitoring.md)
