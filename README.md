# RH OVE Multi-Cluster Ecosystem Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for designing, deploying, and managing Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine (RH OVE) in a multi-cluster architecture.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized around a hub-and-spoke multi-cluster architecture:

- **1 Management Cluster**: Centralized control plane for governance, policy, monitoring, and GitOps
- **N Application Clusters**: Dedicated workload execution environments for virtual machines and containers

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
