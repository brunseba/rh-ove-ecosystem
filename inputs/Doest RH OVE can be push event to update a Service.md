# Doest RH OVE can be push event to update a ServiceNow CMDB or other CMDB

Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine (RH OVE) does not natively provide built-in, out-of-the-box push event capabilities specifically for updating a ServiceNow CMDB or other configuration management databases (CMDB). However, it is **entirely possible**—and widely practiced in enterprise IT—to integrate RH OVE (and OpenShift Virtualization generally) with ServiceNow or other CMDB tools using event-driven automation, custom middleware, or integration platforms.

## How It Can Be Achieved

### 1. **Kubernetes Events and Webhooks**

- RH OVE (powered by KubeVirt and OpenShift) continuously emits **Kubernetes events** for VM lifecycle changes (creation, deletion, updates, migration, etc.)[^1][^2].
- You can capture these events using Kubernetes-native tools (like the `kube-eventer`, custom controllers, or Operators).
- With an **Event-Driven Architecture** (EDA) or Kubernetes webhooks, these events can be forwarded to an external system, such as a middleware service or directly to a CMDB via API calls.


### 2. **Middleware and Automation Tools**

- Enterprises often build an integration layer using platforms like **Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform**, custom scripts, or workflow tools. These listen for RH OVE events (or poll the OpenShift API) and, when VM or infrastructure state changes, format and push updates to ServiceNow's CMDB via its REST API.
- This approach allows you to tailor which VM attributes (name, owner, spec, status, etc.) get reflected in the CMDB and automate incident or change workflows.


### 3. **ServiceNow Integration Mechanisms**

- **ServiceNow IntegrationHub**: Enables API-based ingestion, workflow automation, and supports event-driven updates from external IT platforms[^3].
- **Service Graph Connectors** (recommended by ServiceNow): These are pre-built, maintained connectors designed to keep the CMDB in sync with modern, hybrid environments—though a direct connector for RH OVE/KubeVirt may not exist, custom integrations can bridge the gap.
- **Custom API/Import Sets**: You can use REST API calls or scheduled import sets to push data from RH OVE/OpenShift to ServiceNow CMDB, but real-time event-drive is best achieved with webhooks or middleware.


### 4. **Third-Party and Ecosystem Integrations**

- Some security and IT operations tools (e.g., Apiiro, Flexspring) offer integration between Kubernetes/VM environments and ServiceNow by acting as real-time bridges that reflect environment changes in the CMDB[^4][^5].
- These solutions often add policy, enrichment, and reconciliation logic to ensure CMDB data fidelity.


## Key Considerations

- **Reconciliation and Idempotency**: The integration should deduplicate or reconcile resources to avoid CMDB “drift” and keep records accurate[^3].
- **Security**: All communications, especially event pushes from production clusters, should use secure, authenticated channels (typically via ServiceNow’s MID server or secure APIs).
- **Compliance and Audit Trail**: Pushed events can be logged and audited to comply with regulatory requirements.


## Summary

**RH OVE can absolutely be integrated to push events to update a ServiceNow CMDB or other CMDB platforms for near real-time infrastructure visibility—but this requires building (or deploying) event-driven integrations using OpenShift/KubeVirt events and either ServiceNow IntegrationHub, Service Graph Connectors, or custom REST API and middleware.** There is no “one-click” feature, but the ecosystem supports robust integration patterns that are standard in modern enterprise architectures[^4][^3][^5].
