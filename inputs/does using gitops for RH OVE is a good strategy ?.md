# does using gitops for RH OVE is a good strategy ?

Using a GitOps approach for managing Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine (RH OVE) is widely considered a **good strategy** by both Red Hat and the industry, and offers several key advantages:

## Benefits of GitOps for RH OVE

- **Single Source of Truth:**
By storing all VM configurations, templates, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) in a Git repository, you ensure that your infrastructure state is version-controlled, auditable, and reproducible[^1][^2][^3].
- **Declarative Management:**
All KubeVirt CRDs (like VirtualMachine, Template, DataVolume, etc.) can be defined as YAML manifests tracked and managed in Git, just like other Kubernetes resources. This allows you to declaratively manage VM objects and their lifecycle using standard CI/CD flows and tools[^4][^3].
- **Automation and Reduced Human Error:**
Argo CD (provided via OpenShift GitOps Operator) can synchronize your OpenShift cluster to match whatever is defined in Git, automating creation, modification, and deletion of VMs and related resources. Manual intervention is minimized, reducing mistakes and ensuring compliance with organizational standards[^1][^2][^5][^6].
- **Change Auditing and Rollbacks:**
All changes to VM templates, configurations, and deployments are tracked in Git, making it straightforward to review, audit, or revert changes after errors or incidents. This fosters operational confidence and simplifies troubleshooting[^1][^4][^3].
- **Seamless Collaboration \& Consistency:**
Teams collaborate through pull-requests and code reviews on the Git repository. This ensures that production deployments are peer-reviewed and consistent across environments (dev, staging, prod)[^4].
- **Scalability and Multi-Cluster Support:**
GitOps makes it easier to scale infrastructure and manage VM workloads across multiple OpenShift clusters, whether for edge, on-prem, or hybrid-cloud scenarios[^6][^7].


## How Does GitOps Work with RH OVE?

1. Store all desired VM definitions (YAML) in Git.
2. Use Argo CD (OpenShift GitOps Operator) to monitor the repository and apply any changes automatically to the cluster.
3. VM lifecycle (creation, update, deletion) becomes driven by Git commits and merges, aligning infrastructure management with development workflows[^1][^2][^5][^6][^8].

## Best Practices

- Keep your repository structure clear and separate environments (dev, prod) with folders or branches.
- Use templating tools if you have many similar VM configs.
- Always use pull-requests and peer review processes for changes to infrastructure code.
- Apply automated validation or policies (Open Policy Agent or Kubernetes admission controllers) before merge/deploy.


## Conclusion

**GitOps brings modern, reliable, and scalable infrastructure-as-code practices to RH OVE**, helping organizations automate VM lifecycle management, streamline operations, and improve auditability, consistency, and velocity of changes. Adopting GitOps with OpenShift Virtualization is considered a best practice for most teams running KubeVirt-based VMs in production environments[^1][^9][^4][^3][^2][^8].
