# Does using rubrik to backup VM on RH OVE is a good idea

Using **Rubrik** to back up VMs in Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine (RH OVE) is not only a good idea—it’s an enterprise-best-practice approach, officially supported by both Rubrik and Red Hat.

### Why Rubrik Is a Strong Choice for RH OVE Backup

- **Certified and Supported Integration**: Rubrik Security Cloud is certified to protect Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization environments. The partnership between Rubrik and Red Hat ensures ongoing support and feature compatibility for production environments[^1][^2][^3].
- **Purpose-Built for Hybrid Workloads**: Rubrik protects both Kubernetes-native workloads (pods, persistent volumes, CRDs) and virtual machines managed by OpenShift Virtualization. This means you can use a single platform to manage backup, disaster recovery, and cyber-resilience for both containers and VMs[^1][^4][^3].
- **Zero Trust and Immutable Backups**: Rubrik provides tamper-proof, air-gapped backups with encryption and fine-grained access controls. Backups are immune to ransomware and insider threats, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and RBAC baked in[^1][^3].
- **Efficient, Automated Protection**:
    - **Automated VM discovery**: Rubrik agents automatically detect and protect new VMs, reducing manual overhead.
    - **Policy-driven SLAs**: Declaratively define backup frequency, retention, and recovery points using flexible policies.
    - **Incremental-forever protection**: Only changed data is copied after the initial full backup, minimizing impact on the cluster[^1][^4].
- **Granular and Rapid Recovery Options**: Instantly browse, mount, and restore VMs or files—supporting fast recovery from incidents or disasters. Flexible restore options let you recover to the same or different namespaces, or restore individual files as needed[^1][^3].
- **Operational Simplicity**: Backup and restore processes are highly automated. The Rubrik agent runs only during backup/restore operations, limiting operational overhead and resource impact on the OpenShift cluster[^4][^3].
- **Enterprise-Grade Security and Compliance**: Rubrik enforces consistent security policies, supports compliance needs, and provides auditing capabilities that are essential for regulated environments[^1][^3].


### How Does the Backup Work?

1. **Automated Discovery**: Rubrik auto-discovers VMs and persistent volumes in your OpenShift environment.
2. **Snapshot-Based Backups**: It uses snapshots of persistent volumes for crash-consistent (or file-system consistent, if you use in-VM agents) backups, copying data out-of-band to the Rubrik cluster.
3. **Rapid Recovery**: Restore can be performed on-demand via Rubrik’s dashboard, CLI, or via Kubernetes-native tools using CRDs[^4][^3].
4. **Integration With OpenShift Tools**: Rubrik does not replace native OpenShift backup tools (like OADP/Velero), but augments them with additional enterprise security, SLA, and analytics features.

### Conclusion

**Rubrik is a highly recommended and fully supported solution for backing up VMs in RH OVE clusters**. It offers robust automation, enterprise security, fast recovery, and seamless integration across both Kubernetes workloads and virtualized VMs. For organizations seeking a unified, compliant, and secure backup approach as they modernize their infrastructure with OpenShift Virtualization, Rubrik is an excellent choice[^1][^2][^3].
