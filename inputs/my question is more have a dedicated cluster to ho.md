# my question is more have a dedicated cluster to host management workloads

Adopting a **dedicated cluster to host management workloads**—such as GitOps tools (Argo CD), backup and disaster recovery solutions (Velero/OADP, Trilio, Rubrik), monitoring stacks, or centralized CI/CD pipelines—is a recommended and increasingly common strategy for large Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine (RH OVE) environments.

## Key Reasons to Use a Dedicated Management Cluster

### 1. **Operational Separation for Resilience and Security**

- Isolating management components from production application or VM clusters reduces risk; outages or resource contention in production workloads cannot interfere with critical management functions.
- Dedicated clusters enhance compliance by allowing tighter RBAC and network segmentation for sensitive management services[^1][^2].


### 2. **Centralized Control and Efficiency**

- Central management clusters easily run multi-cluster management tools such as Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM), enabling policy, lifecycle operations, and monitoring across many OpenShift/RH OVE clusters from a single pane of glass[^3][^4].
- Streamlines upgrades, scaling, and lifecycle tasks for management services without affecting or being affected by heterogeneous application workloads.


### 3. **High Availability and Performance for Management Services**

- Management workloads can be sized, tuned, and upgraded independently for high-priority operations like cluster backup, DR orchestration, and audit logging.
- Removes noisy neighbor problems: large/distributed application VMs or pods can't “starve” management components for memory, I/O, or CPU[^1].


### 4. **Multi-Cluster and Hybrid-Cloud Ready**

- It aligns with hybrid or multi-cluster best practices where a single management hub operates across multiple workload clusters, regardless of cloud or datacenter boundaries[^3].
- Tools such as OpenShift Cluster Manager and ACM are specifically designed for this topology and enable policy-based placement, health/risk monitoring, and application lifecycle management organization-wide[^2][^5].


### 5. **Scalability and Simplified Disaster Recovery**

- In large environments, managing cluster state, policies, and DR routines centrally improves scalability and compliance, and can reduce operational costs[^3].
- With a control cluster dedicated to management tools, restoring or rebuilding applications in other RH OVE clusters is easier and faster, supporting robust business continuity.


## Best Practices and Considerations

- Size your management cluster for peak load from all managed clusters (sizing guidelines are available from Red Hat for ACM, Argo CD, and OADP/Velero).
- Use network policies and firewalls to tightly control which clusters and management tools communicate.
- Prefer highly available, multi-AZ topologies for management clusters, mirroring application HA practices.
- Centralize logging and monitoring for both management and managed clusters.


## Summary

**Having a dedicated cluster for management workloads is not only recommended, it is considered a best practice for large, mission-critical RH OVE environments.** This approach significantly increases operational safety, resilience, observability, and standardization for both application and infrastructure management, especially in hybrid and multi-cluster deployments[^1][^3][^2].
