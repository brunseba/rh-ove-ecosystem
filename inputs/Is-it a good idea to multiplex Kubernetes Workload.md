# Is-it a good idea to multiplex Kubernetes Workload and VM Workload on the same RH OVE Cluster

Multiplexing (i.e., running both Kubernetes container workloads and traditional VM workloads) on the same Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine (RH OVE) cluster is widely regarded as not just feasible, but *highly advantageous* for many enterprise scenarios. This hybrid approach is officially supported by Red Hat and is increasingly adopted in production environments.

## **Key Benefits**

- **Unified Management:**
OpenShift Virtualization enables admins and developers to manage both containers and VMs through the same Kubernetes-native interface. This streamlines day-to-day operations, reduces tool sprawl, and leverages consistent workflows for all workloads[^1][^2][^3].
- **Optimized Resource Utilization:**
Mixing VMs and containers on the same cluster allows for better hardware consolidation, reducing overhead and making full use of available compute, memory, and storage resources[^2][^4].
- **Flexibility \& Modernization:**
Many enterprises have legacy applications that require VMs (for example: Windows applications or databases), while new microservices run as containers. Running both on the same platform lets organizations gradually modernize, migrate, or refactor legacy workloads on their terms[^1][^5][^2].
- **Streamlined DevOps and CI/CD:**
By running VMs and containers side by side, teams can integrate those workloads into the same CI/CD pipelines, automate deployments, and standardize monitoring/logging practices across all application types[^2][^5].
- **Advanced Platform Features:**
Both workload types benefit from OpenShift features like high availability, dynamic storage provisioning, built-in logging/monitoring, and robust security policies[^2][^6][^3].


## **Potential Challenges \& Considerations**

- **Resource Contention:**
As VMs are heavier than containers, careful resource planning (CPU, memory, storage I/O) is critical. Properly defined requests/limits and robust node sizing are required to avoid “noisy neighbor” issues.
- **Complexity in Large, Mixed Clusters:**
As the cluster grows and workload types diversify, management overhead increases. Red Hat recommends considering multiple clusters for especially large or segregated (e.g., prod/test) environments[^7].
- **Security and Isolation:**
OpenShift provides strong multi-tenancy and network segmentation (via namespaces, network policies, and CNIs like Calico or Cilium), but administrators must consistently enforce these to maintain isolation between sensitive workloads[^2][^6].
- **Operational Expertise:**
Running traditional VMs in a Kubernetes-native way can introduce a learning curve for teams used only to “classic” virtualization. However, OpenShift’s web console and APIs ease this transition substantially[^5][^4].


## **Best Practices**

- **Leverage Namespaces for Segregation:**
Place VM and container workloads in dedicated namespaces/projects for security and operational clarity.
- **Use Resource Quotas and Limits:**
Define quotas to prevent resource starvation or runaway workloads.
- **Adopt GitOps and Declarative Management:**
Store both VM and container definitions as code in Git repositories for version control, auditability, and automated deployment[^2].
- **Implement RBAC and Network Policies:**
Enforce fine-grained access controls and microsegmentation between teams and workload types.
- **Monitor, Log, and Backup:**
Integrate VMs into your cluster’s central monitoring, alerting, and backup processes, using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and OADP/Velero.


## **Summary**

**It is a good idea to multiplex Kubernetes and VM workloads on the same RH OVE cluster—provided that you plan for resource management, use OpenShift’s multi-tenancy features, and consistently apply best practices.** This setup simplifies operations, supports gradual modernization, and maximizes your infrastructure investment, without requiring a disruptive “all-or-nothing” transition[^1][^2][^5][^4][^3].
