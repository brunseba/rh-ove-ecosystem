# Does using cilium is a good idea to enhanced network security into RH OVE

Using **Cilium** to enhance network security in a Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine (RH OVE) cluster is widely regarded as a strong, future-proof approach—for several reasons:

### Certified Integration with OpenShift

- **Red Hat Certification:** Cilium is a certified Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in for OpenShift[^1][^2]. This means deployments with Cilium are fully supported by Red Hat and ecosystem partners, ensuring a seamless support experience for production clusters.


### Advanced Network Security Features

- **eBPF-Powered Enforcement:** Cilium uses eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), a Linux kernel technology that allows for extremely flexible, high-performance security, visibility, and traffic control. With eBPF, Cilium provides:
    - Fine-grained, identity-aware network policies (not just IP-based, but label-based).
    - Deny and allow policies for zero-trust segmentation[^3][^4].
    - High-performance transparent encryption with IPsec or WireGuard.
    - Real-time network monitoring and observability.
- **Service Mesh \& API Awareness:** Cilium brings L7 (HTTP/API aware) security and observability out-of-the-box, even supporting service mesh capabilities without requiring sidecar proxies[^5][^4].


### Scalability and Performance

- **High Scale \& Low Latency:** Cilium can handle large, complex clusters with greater performance than traditional iptables- or IPVS-based CNIs[^6][^4]. This is especially true in bare-metal or hybrid environments, where VM and container workloads coexist.


### Multi-platform Support

- **Works for Both Containers and VMs:** Cilium supports hybrid Kubernetes environments, including those running KubeVirt/OpenShift Virtualization workloads in addition to regular pods, making it suitable for RH OVE clusters that host both VMs and containers[^7][^8].


### Observability, Compliance, and Troubleshooting

- **Best-in-class Observability:** With features like Hubble, you get deep, real-time network visibility, compliance auditing, and faster troubleshooting for all workload types[^8][^4].
- **Unified Policy Model:** Network security policy can be applied consistently across all workloads—VMs and containers—using the same Cilium constructs and Kubernetes interfaces.


### Implementation Notes

- **Installation:** Cilium can be installed via the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog, with robust documentation and community/vendor support[^9][^1][^10].
- **Considerations:** For maximum benefit (like eBPF-based kube-proxy replacement and encryption), Cilium should be used as the primary CNI. It is also possible to use Cilium as a secondary CNI via Multus, but this may limit some features[^11].

**In summary:**
Using Cilium in RH OVE clusters is a good—and proven—strategy to enhance network security, observability, microsegmentation, and scaling, leveraging eBPF and modern Zero Trust principles. It is enterprise-ready, OpenShift-certified, and improves both security and operational agility in clusters combining VMs and containers[^1][^8][^2].
